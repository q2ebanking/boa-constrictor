## [0.6.0] - 2020-12-02

### Changed

This release contains major changes to RestSharp Screenplay support.
Changes are **not** backwards-compatible.

- Previously, there was one Ability named `CallRestApi` that could hold multiple `IRestClient` RestSharp client objects.
  Each RestSharp Interaction would need a base URL as an input, and it would look up the appropriate client object from the Ability.
  However, this was not the best design because it required each call to include a base URL, which led to repetitive code.

- Now, there can be multiple Abilities for calling REST APIs using RestSharp.
  One RestSharp Ability has only one `IRestClient` object.
  Users should write their own Ability class for each base URL they want to use.
  `IRestSharpAbility` provides the interface for RestSharp Abilities, with properties and methods for clients, dumpers, and cookies.
  `AbstractRestSharpAbility` implements most of the pieces from `IRestSharpAbility`.
  Custom RestSharp Abilities should either implement `IRestSharpAbility` or extend `AbstractRestSharpAbility`.
  The `CallRestApi` Ability still exists as a "common" or "default" RestSharp Ability.
  It extends `AbstractRestSharpAbility`.

- All RestSharp interactions have been updated with a generic type parameter for an `IRestSharpAbility` Ability.
  This type parameter dictates which Ability will be used by the interaction, thus determining the RestSharp client and thereby the base URL.
  For simplicity, the `Rest` static class's builder methods now each have two versions:
  one with a type generic to specify the RestSharp Ability, and one without a type generic that uses `CallRestApi` as a "default" Ability.

- RestSharp interactions for cookies have been removed because they simply made changes to the `IRestClient` object instead of performing real interactions.
  They have been replaced by `IRestSharpAbility` methods.

- RestSharp interactions for calling requests and downloads have also changed significantly.
  `RestApiResponse` has been renamed to `RestApiCall` for readability.
  `RestFileDownload` has been renamed to `RestApiDownload` for consistency.
  Both no longer have in-class builder methods.
  Instead, the `Rest` class holds the only public builder methods for them.
  You *must* use the `Rest` class to instantiate them.
  Both also now share a parent class named `AbstractRestQuestion`.

Examples of new RestSharp interactions:

```csharp
IActor actor = new Actor();

// Simple "default" RestSharp client calls
actor.Can(CallRestApi.At("www.somebaseurl.com"));
IRestRequest request = new RestRequest(...);
IRestResponse response = actor.Calls(Rest.Request(request));

// Custom RestSharp client calls
// Assume `CallOtherApi` is a class that implements `IRestSharpAbility`
// Assume `DataObject` is a deserialization class
actor.Can(CallOtherApi.At("www.someotherapi.com"));
IRestRequest request2 = new RestRequest(...);
IRestResponse<DataObject> response2 = actor.Calls(Rest.RequestUsing<CallOtherApi, DataObject>(request2));
```
